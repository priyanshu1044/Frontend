# Food Ordering App

This project is a simple restaurant search application built with React.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for restaurants by name. This feature is still in its early stages and will be improved in future updates.
- **React Hooks**: This project uses the `useState` hook for state management.
- **Project Structure**: The project follows a common folder structure for React applications, with separate components for each part of the app.

## What I Learned

- **useState Hook**: I learned how to use the `useState` hook for managing state in a functional component. This hook allows you to add React state to function components.
- **Search Functionality**: I implemented a basic search functionality that filters restaurants based on their names. This was a great exercise in understanding how to manipulate arrays and state in React.
- **Project Structure**: I learned how to structure a React project in a scalable way, separating concerns into different components.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Search**: The current search functionality is basic and will be improved in future updates. The goal is to make the search more robust and user-friendly.
