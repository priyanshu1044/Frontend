- **Modern UI**: The application has a modern and clean user interface.
- **Microservice Monolith Architecture Awareness**: Learned about the difference between Microservice and Monolith architecture and their implications.

## Learning Objectives

### React Concepts

- **`useEffect` Hook**: Explored the useEffect hook to understand its behavior and when it is called in the component lifecycle.
- **`Dependency Array` in `useEffect`**: Experimented with the dependency array in the useEffect hook to control when the effect is executed.
- **`JS Expression vs JS Statement` Difference**: Understood the distinction between JavaScript expressions and statements.
- **`Conditional Rendering`**: Implemented conditional rendering in React components based on certain conditions.

### Web Development Concepts

- **`CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)`**: Learned about CORS and its role in allowing or restricting resource sharing between different origins.
- **`async/await`**: Explored the usage of async and await in asynchronous JavaScript code for handling promises.

### UI/UX Design

- **`Shimmer UI`**: Implemented Shimmer UI to provide a loading effect when data is not yet loaded.

## Coding Assignment

1. **`useEffect Hook` Exploration**:
   - Investigated when the useEffect hook is called in the component lifecycle (before or after render).
   - Explored the impact of the dependency array in the useEffect hook.

2. **`Developer Console Debugging`**:
   - Placed a debugger in the render and useEffect to inspect the application flow in the developer console.

3. **`Actual API Call`**:
   - Implemented an actual API call to fetch real-world data.

4. **`Error Handling in API Call`**:
   - Implemented error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle API call errors.

5. **`Shimmer UI for Data Loading`**:
   - Created a Shimmer UI to enhance the user experience during data loading.

6. **`Search Functionality Implementation`**:
   - Developed the search functionality to allow users to search for restaurants.

7. **`Login/Logout Button with State`**:
   - Implemented a login/logout button that toggles based on the user's authentication state.
